# OSINT Web Demo 

This page is designed according to the design found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/0Mmvi5RfRTmjm3zQzEazF6/Trial-Design---OSINT-Industries?type=design&node-id=301-474&mode=design&t=TOrUGtRZIOFYWX8s-0) built with React (Typescript), and Tailwind. 

Some of the assets were quite hard to export so the main banner background image isn't being included for now.
Deployed version can be found [here](https://osint-web-liart.vercel.app/)

## Setup 
- After cloning the project, run ```npm install``` in the root dir to install dependencies
